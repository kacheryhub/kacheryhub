# How to host a kachery node

You can host a kachery node by running a kachery daemon on your computer. Once the daemon is running, you can register the node on kacheryhub and configure the node using the web interface.

## Requirements

Tested on Linux, should also work on macOS and Windows Subsystem for Linux

We recommend that you use a Conda environment with

* Python >=3.8
* NumPy
* Nodejs >=12 (available on conda-forge; see below)

## Installation using Conda

```bash
conda create --name kachery-env python=3.8 numpy>=1.19.0
conda activate kachery-env

conda install -c conda-forge nodejs
pip install --upgrade kachery-daemon

# On macOS you may need to use the following to get a recent version of nodejs (>=12):
# conda install nodejs -c conda-forge --repodata-fn=repodata.json
```

## Installation without conda

It is also possible to install without conda. Just make sure that the above requirements are met on your system, and then `pip install --upgrade kachery-daemon` as above.

## Running the daemon

Ensure you are in the correct conda environment, then:

```bash
kachery-daemon-start --label <name-of-node> --owner <your-google-account-id>
```

where `<name-of-node>` is a node label for display purposes and `<your-google-account-id>` must match the kacheryhub login google account.


Keep this daemon running in a terminal. You may want to use [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) or a similar tool to keep this daemon running even if the terminal is closed.

Other more advanced options are available, such as specifying listen ports (see below).

## Obtaining the node ID

You can obtain the unique ID for your running kachery node by using the following command:

```bash
kachery-daemon-info
# will print the kachery node ID
```

## Adding the node on kacheryhub

To add your node to kacheryhub, make sure you are logged in to kacheryhub using the same google account as specified in the --owner flag when running the daemon. Then click the `add kachery node` button and enter the node ID obtained above.

## Advanced configuration

Environment variables for the daemon

* `KACHERY_STORAGE_DIR` **(optional)** - Refers to an existing directory on your local computer. This is where kachery stores all of your cached files. If not set, files will be stored in the default location: `$HOME/kachery-storage`.
* `KACHERY_DAEMON_PORT` **(optional)** - Port that the daemon will listen on. If not provided, a default port will be used.

Environment variables for the client

* `KACHERY_DAEMON_PORT` **(optional)** - Port for connecting to the daemon (should match the above)
* `KACHERY_DAEMON_HOST` **(optional)** - Host for connecting to the daemon
* `KACHERY_TEMP_DIR` **(optional)** - Existing directory where temporary files are stored - not the same as `KACHERY_STORAGE_DIR`.
