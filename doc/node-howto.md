# How to Run and Configure a kachery Node

Most of the action in the kachery network involves communication between
[nodes](./node.md). These are the network peers that exchange information
and maintain offline storage in the content-addressable database; nodes
may also optionally be the owners of [feeds](./feeds.md) or provide
[task execution resources](tasks.md).

To get started working with the kachery network, simply set up your
own node, register it with [kacheryhub](./hub.md), and join a [channel](./channel.md). Once the
channel owner has granted your node access permissions, you will be able
to exchange information with other nodes on the channel.
